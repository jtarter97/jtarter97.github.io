<p> 
    
    The lodges advertise that they are less then two hours out of Chicago.

    Along with this they have several different tours some over trolly and some with land guides. One thing that is only available if you go to the lodge is the tours of the waters if starved rock.
    
    This is also a destination for many wedding and special events offering booking in the lodge for special events
    
    The lodge also has restaurant for dinning and entertainment
    
    
    Starved rock is beautiful and the lodge is a great experience to get a full knowledge of this natural park
